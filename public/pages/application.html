        Cartwheels and Banana Peels is a podcast with a twist! Each episode is less than 10 minutes, 
        so busy women entrepreneurs can listen to quick tales about their sisters' mishaps and laugh out-loud moments in life and business. 
        WARNING: You might just spit out your coffee laughing. Oh, and for heaven's sakes, drive safe. 
        We don't want you trying to explain to the "weeeeooo, weeeeoooos" üöî why you backed over that trash can and then sped away after running over the curb...
        because these stories may very well crack you up! üòÜ
      </p>
      <p>
        Submit your information below including the overview of a funny story you'd like to share.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're accepted and invited to be a guest, you'll be asked to submit three audio files (or one with clear 5-10 second quiet gaps between each section). 
        The three sections (audio files) will be as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Who you are and what you do - keep it under 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your funny mishap in life or business - it should be 3-4 minutes in length
        </li>
        <li>
          Where people can connect with you - one clear go-to place (your website, your Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. or perhaps your own podcast). 
          When sharing where to connect with you, you are allowed to very briefly share your lead magnet offer - keep this section under 1 minute
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If you feel unsure of what funny story to tell or how to tell it, let me know that below and I'll reach out to see how I can help you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I look forward to reviewing your application and getting back with you.

  <p>
    Note: This is a super exciting time to be a part of the Cartwheels and Banana Peels podcast 
    because though I've podcasted since before anyone knew what podcasts were (starting way back in 2009), this is a brand new podcast with a unique twist. 
    Annnnnnd, we're launching a bunch of the initial episodes on...drum roll please...ü•Å ü•Å ü•Å April Fool's Day 2024!
  </p>
  <p>
    You'll receive links, social media copy and email copy to help promote the podcast and your episode!
  </p>
  <p>
    You'll be a founding guest which means when people come across the podcast in the future they will likely go back and start at the beginning 
    and that means even more people listening to your episode(s). üéâ üëè
